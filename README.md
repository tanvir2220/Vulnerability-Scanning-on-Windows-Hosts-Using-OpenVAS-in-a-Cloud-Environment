<h1>Vulnerability Scanning on Windows Hosts Using OpenVAS in a Cloud Environment</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
The project involves creation of OpenVAS server and client virtual machines (VMs) within the Azure cloud and performing vulnerability scanning on hosts.
<br />

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Microsoft Azure</b>
- <b>OpenVAS - Open Vulnerability Assessment Scanner</b>

<h2>To-Do</h2>

To successfully complete the project, we need to perform following tasks:

1.	Create Free Azure Subscription
2.	Prepare OpenVAS Vulnerability Management Scanner 
3.	Create Client Virtual Machine and Make it Vulnerable 
4.	Conducting the First Unauthenticated Scan 
5.	Make Configurations for Credentialed Scans (Within VM) 
6.	Make Configurations for Credentialed Scans (OpenVAS) 
7.	Execute Credentialed Scan against our Vulnerable Windows VM
8.	Remediate Vulnerabilities
9.	Rescan and Verification



<h2>Program Walk-Through</h2>

1.	Create Free Azure Subscription: First of all, I created free Azure Subscription. Make sure you delete the resource group that has all of our resources in it otherwise it will eat up our subscription cost. Here's the link: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/ . Then login to the Azure Portal. Here's the link: https://portal.azure.com/#home
   
2.	Prepare OpenVAS Vulnerability Management Scanner
